I worked on the Medico project, an online medical store that allows users to browse and order healthcare products easily. For the backend, we used Spring Boot with MySQL to manage data and create secure REST APIs, while the frontend was built using React to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. My role involved setting up key backend features, like JWT-based authentication for secure login and role-based access control, so that admins and users had different access levels. I also helped design the MySQL database, organizing it with tables for users, products, orders, and carts. On the frontend, I integrated APIs to display products, manage the cart, and handle orders. We followed an Agile workflow, using GitHub for version control and testing each part thoroughly. This project not only gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development but also taught me the value of teamwork, problem-solving, and building user-friendly applications.
